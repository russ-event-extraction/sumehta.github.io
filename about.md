Hi there! Thanks for visiting my blog. I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech. Currently I'm focused on solving problems in Natural Language Processing using Deep Learning tools. Some of the problems that interest me include, attention mechanisms, representation learning, text summarization and question answering.
