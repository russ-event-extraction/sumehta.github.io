Hi there! Thanks for visiting my blog. I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech. Currently I'm focused on solving problems in Natural Language Processing using Deep Learning tools. In the past, I have worked at Dreamworks Animation and Netflix. Some of the problems that interest me include attention mechanisms for representation learning, information extraction, text summarization, question answering and machine translation.
